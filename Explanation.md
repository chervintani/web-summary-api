## Overview
The project consists of a web service built using Node.js and Express. It allows users to submit a URL, which the service then scrapes for content, summarizes it using OpenAI's API, and stores the results in a MongoDB database.

## Components
1. ### Web Server:
- Implemented with Express to handle HTTP requests.
- Offers endpoints to receive URLs for scraping and retrieve summaries by ID.

2. ### Web Scraper:
- Uses Axios to fetch HTML content from the provided URLs.
- Utilizes Cheerio to parse and extract meaningful content (title, meta description, and main text).

3. ### Text Summarization:
- Integrates with the OpenAI API to summarize the scraped content.
- Sends the scraped data to OpenAI’s language model, receiving a concise summary in response.

4. ### Database
- MongoDB is used to store summaries, maintaining a record of processed URLs and their summaries for future reference.

## Workflow
1. The user sends a POST request with a URL to the /api/summary endpoint.
2. The service verifies if the URL has already been processed.
3. If not, it scrapes the content from the URL.
4. The scraped content is sent to the OpenAI API for summarization.
5. The summary is stored in MongoDB, and a response is returned to the user.

## Technical Decisions
- ### Framework Choice:
  - Express was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use, allowing for quick setup and routing capabilities.
- ### Database:
  - MongoDB was selected for its flexibility in storing unstructured data, which is suitable for storing summaries and URLs.
- ### Scraping Library:
  - Cheerio was utilized due to its jQuery-like syntax, making it straightforward to parse HTML and extract content.
- ### AI Integration:
  - OpenAI's API was integrated for summarization, providing a reliable way to generate high-quality summaries without requiring extensive machine learning expertise.

## API Requests Examples

### 1. Request a new job to summarize website
Endpoint: `POST` `http://localhost:3000/api/summary?url=<url>`

### 2. Request to get website summary by ID
Endpoint: `GET` `http://localhost:3000/api/summary/<id>`
